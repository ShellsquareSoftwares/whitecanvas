## Features

The white canvas can perform multiple operations like Adding any images into the canvas,Dragging, Resizing, Grouping, Ungrouping, Bring to Front & Sent to back.

The grouping and ungrouping property is enabled on the context-menu

Grouping in the sense, group multiple images into a single image group and then we can again regroup the already grouped items.

The already grouped images can be ungrouped and extracted to the original position using the ungrouping option.

Resizing is possible along the horizontal, vertical and diagonal axes.

For resizing, two types of algorithms are used.
The first is for resizing the grouped elements
And the second is for resizing the multiselected elements.

This canvas performs operations based on mouse events. Also there are options for Turn On & Turn Off Grid Lines. There is an optional read only mode that is configurable in the html, which disables all the mouse operations inside the canvas.
